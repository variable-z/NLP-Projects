# NLP and CNN Projects

Welcome to my repository of machine learning projects! This repository includes three distinct projects related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Below you will find a brief overview of each project, their objectives, and how to run them.

## Project 1: News Classification using Natural Language Processing
**Objective**: This project aims at building a model which classifies whether the news given is genuine news or false news to avoid panic among the people and bring awareness.
### Features
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Utilization of various NLP models for classification.
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project 2: Recognition of Objects with Convolutional Neural Network
**Objective**: This project focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize and classify objects in images. It utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset to train and test the CNN model.
### Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation.
- CNN architecture design and training.
- Model evaluation and accuracy measurement.

## Project 3: Handwritten Digit Classification Using CNN
**Objective**: This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It aims to accurately recognize digits from 0 to 9
### Features
- CNN model design and implementation.
- Use of the MNIST dataset for training and validation.
- Evaluation of model performance with accuracy and loss metrics.
  
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `tensorflow` or `pytorch`,`matplotlib`

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required packages
4. Run the script to train and evaluate the model

### Additional Information
Data: Ensure that you have the necessary datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST) downloaded and placed in the appropriate directories as specified in each project.
Contributions: If you would like to contribute to any of these projects, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
For further details, please refer to the specific project directories where you'll find additional documentation and code.


Replace placeholders like `variable-z`, `NLP-Projects`. Also, ensure that the project directories and file names match the actual structure of your repository.
